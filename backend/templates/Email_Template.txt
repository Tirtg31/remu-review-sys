Subject: Remun
Hello, 

UnitingCare ensures that the remuneration of its salaried employees is appropriate, having regard to a number of factors including any underpinning industrial instrument (Award). With the increases provided by Fair Work Commissioner (FWC) from July, we conducted a review of all salaried employees to check compliance against the relevant industrial instrument (where applicable).

Attached is letter/s for salaried employees who require a compliance uplift; could you please print, sign and distribute these letters. Increases will be backdated to the first full pay in July, aligned to the Modern Award increases.
How will increases be applied for salaried employees during Annual Remuneration Review (Aug-Sept):

•	If receiving a compliance uplift of 3.25% or more, no further increase will apply during this year’s review (which is noted in their letter). 
•	If the compliance uplift is less than 3.25%, or they do not require a compliance increase (i.e no letter provided), their remuneration will be considered as part of this year’s review, based on their performance and relativity to the new remuneration range. 

If you have any questions please contact your People and Culture Business Partner.

Regards,
Remuneration Team
